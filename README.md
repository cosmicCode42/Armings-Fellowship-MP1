# Armings Quest

Milestone Project for the Introduction to Web Development course offered by Code Institute. A site giving information about a party of adventurers hailing from, or affiliated with, the village of Armings in the Neverwinter Woods.

**Technologies Used:** HTML5, CSS3; Bootstrap 4.5.3.

## Site Plan

### UX
- Intended audience: myself and my friends, as well as other people that might be interested in following our group's adventures.
- Goals: provide information about all the characters in the party as well as an overview of the group's adventures and accomplishments.

#### Will need the following:
- An index page with a hero image - the four heroes of Armings: Bell, Subao, Corlan Falster, and Sun Mullnir.
	- Heading: ARMINGS QUEST
	- Image is the commission Poison got for the characters.
	- Section: Welcome to the Fellowship!
	- Also have links to each of the characters' pages.
- Character pages!
	- an individual page for each character (4 pages in all)
		- Header can be an IC quote; under it, give a brief overview of the character.
			- Include class, (summary of history?), and personality
		- Character picture set to the left of the page; text in a separate section to the right.

#### Will also want the following:
- History of the Fellowship!
	- A brief overview of Armings Quest adventures; use the timeline from the CV site!
	- Probably something to add for the future.
- Friends of the Fellowship pages!
	- Something to add for the future: details of the assorted allies of the party.
